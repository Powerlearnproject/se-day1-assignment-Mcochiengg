Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software application system

The importance of software engineering is but not limited to 
1. Helps in quality assurance to reduce bugs and vulnerability leading to a better experience.
2. To help grow and accommodate an increase in a business structure and workload.
3. Project framework for project management.
4. Helps in innovation for the rapid revolution

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The Birth of Software Engineering (1968). software engineering was launched officially during the NATO software conference.
2. A structured program for coding was introduced in the 1970s
3. The Agile Manifesto was introduced in 2001 to bridge the limitations of traditional software methodologies.



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning Phase: In this phase the scope of the project is defined, its objectives outlined and the feasibility is derived.
2. Analysis stage: The details are gathered in this stage and documentation is done, this involves understanding of the stakeholders.
3. Design Phase: This phase translates the requirements into a blueprint for the software, this includes user interface, database design, and others.
4. Implementation phase: Here the actual development and coding are done to build up the software.
5. Testing phase: After Implementation, the software is exposed to rigorous testing to identify and fix defects.
6. Deployment Phase: In this phase, the software is released to the user and this involves the rollout.
7. Maintenance Phase: This is the final phase which includes ongoing support and maintenance of the software.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall follows a strict step-by-step approach where a phase of the project must be completed before moving to the next phase. And agile methodology breaks the project into smaller manageable units allowing for gradual progress and continued evaluation.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software Developer writes, test and maintains  codes for software applications, Designs, collaborates and documents the codes.
2. Quality assurance engineer tests, develops and executes testing plans, He also defects tracking and identifying documents.
3. Project Manager in software engineering helps in project planning, Resource management, Risk management, and stakeholder communication.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. IDEs provide a unified interface that integrates several development tools, such as code editors
2. IDEs offer features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and intelligent error detection, which help developers write code faster and with fewer errors.
   

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges

Unclear Requirements
Challenge: Ambiguous or constantly changing requirements can lead to frustration and misalignment between stakeholders and development teams.

Strategies:

Active Communication: Engage in regular discussions with stakeholders to clarify requirements and gather feedback. Use techniques such as interviews, workshops, and user stories


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing involves testing individual components and functions of the software to validate that each unit performs as expected.

Integrated testing focuses on verifying the interaction between different components and module checks if they work together as expected.

System testing: Assesses the complete integrated software to evaluate its compliance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt Engineering is the process of designing and refining input prompts to optimise response generated by AI

THE IMPORTANCE ARE TO IMPROVE THE INTERPRETABILITY OF THE MODEL
IMPROVE OUTPUT QUALITY
REDUCES AMBIGUITY

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
